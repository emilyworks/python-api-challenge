# python-api-challenge

Keywords: Python, matplotlib, pandas, APIs (OpenWeather API, Google Places API), heatmap visualizations

In this excercise, I extracted weather data for over 500 cities from the OpenWeather API and plotted the data to provide an overview of a variety of basic weather patterns. 
Next, I created weather heatmaps using jupyter-gmaps and Google Places API and marked out places with weather I found personally appealing (ideal for a vacation!).
